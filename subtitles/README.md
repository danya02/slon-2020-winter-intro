# TL;DR: [this file](This problem seems hard, then it doesn't, but it really is-M64HUIJFTZM.ru.vtt)

AKA "The problem with YouTube".

Apparently I had inadvertently completed this task about 3 months ago, when I translated the subtitles for [a video by 3Blue1Brown](https://youtu.be/M64HUIJFTZM). At the time I just thought the video was about a neat puzzle that I wanted to share with a friend who doesn't know English.

Even though YouTube isn't technically a MOOC like Coursera and Stepik and KhanAcademy and the usual suspects, a private conversation with Alexey Fionov (this task's author) confirmed that this is acceptable. Besides 3B1B's [excellent linear algebra series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) taught me much more than I am supposed to know at this point in the Russian educational program, and yet I've managed to find some use for this knowledge while trying to solve tasks at school.

I recognise that the absence of my name in the credits under the video may cause some scepticism regarding the authorship of the subtitles. Indeed, the only proof of contribution I have is this screenshot of YT's "Your Contributions" tab, which is of course easy to manipulate. In short, you have no way to know if these subtitles were not stolen, except for my claim that I had not been doing the stolling.
